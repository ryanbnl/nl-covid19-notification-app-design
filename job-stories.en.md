# User Stories / Jobs to be Done

The GGD have published an [Schedule of Requirements (PVE)](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/coronavirus-app/documenten/publicaties/2020/05/19/programma-van-eisen) to which the app must conform. In addition we have created our own long list of requirements from the perspective of the people who will eventually use the application. In that list we take consideration for what the users want to do and what they should be able to do.
