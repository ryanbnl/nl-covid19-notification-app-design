# Covid19 Notification App Design

Our intention is make the development and design of the Dutch COVID19 notification application as open and transparent as possible. We will share the designs and related documentation here as early and often as possible so that everyone has the chance to leave feedback and support the project.

## Important:
* **This it not a simple project. Please take the time to read the documentation properly before asking a question.**
* **We are now sharing designs early in the process. Please bear in mind that they are not the final designs: there will be changes made to the visual styles, copy, etc..**
* **We will do our upmost best to read all of the comments and suggestions. However we may not be able to reply to all of them.**

2. If you want to actively contribute to the design then you can request access to the private Figma by sending a DM to [@jelleprins](https://www.twitter.com/jelleprins) with your email address. Then you can create your own page within Figma.
3. You can use GitHub to make suggestions or improvements to the contents of this repository.

### Take a look at the latest designs

The latest version of our designs is share in [this Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/EJ4aJwKnemkxysCZ6aAzFv/Covid-19-notificatie-app-(Read-only)). Here you will see the status of each part of the design: which parts are finished and which parts still require some work.

The page with the highest number is the stable version. For each version there is a changelog available where we list the changes that have been made since the previous release.

Comments and answers made in older shared versions will remain available there.

You can contribute by making questions and comments. All of your suggestions are welcome: we'll do our absolute best to read all of you suggestions, answer all of your questions and incorporate all of the good suggestions into the designs. However we cannot promise that all the suggestions will be incorporated.

### Join the discussion on our Slack channel

Questions or reactions via the Slack community of CodeForNL (`#notificatie-app-design` channel). Register via https://doemee.codefor.nl/. Members of the design team follow the discussion and where possible also join in.

#### Contribute to our public challenges

Sometimes even we don't have all of the the answers so we look to you - the public - for help. We convert the design mountains into challenges which you can contribute to in our publically available Figma file. Everyone on their own page. Want to contribute? Then you can request access by sending a Twitter DM to [@jelleprins](https://www.twitter.com/jelleprins).
