# Usability research

A user-friendly and accessible app. For as many Dutch people as possible. Which helps you and the GGD (Local Health Authority) to fight the coronavirus.

As usability researchers, we contribute by:

- Mapping the role the app plays in fighting the coronavirus and supporting the GGD in this.
- Identifying user expectations, uncertainties and needs that can be used in internal and external communications, the audience campaign and app design. So that it is explained in a fair and clear way what the app does and how it contributes to fighting the Corona pandemic.
- During design and development, continuous testing of the design with different target groups to provide designers and developers with timely and targeted feedback on their design decision.

## Our values / what we stand for:

- Users and GGD employees are our experts, we conduct research together with them.
- We research publicly so that everyone can think along, investigate along and validate our choices. That is why we also share the research results with the design choices.
We do not share data publicly when this can be traced back to individual users or GGD employees and they have not explicitly given permission for this.

## Themes and approach

The main research questions are:

- What are peoples needs and expectations with respect to a notification app? And what not?
- How does the app support the GGD processes around testing and source/contact tracing?
- Do people understand the structure of the app and can they use it?
- Do people understand the information in the app and what it does and doesn't do?
- Do people understand what they need to know and do after a notification?
- How can we ensure that the adoption rate of the app is as high as possible?

We do this by:

- Testing what has been thought up with people every week (usability research)
- Testing for maximum accessibility for everyone who wants to use the app (accessibility research)
- Walking through the process with the GGD in their workplace (observation and interviews)
- Interviewing people who have had the coronavirus before and their contacts (interviews)
- To work together with the Taskforce Behavioral Sciences from RIVM (National Institute for Public Health and the Environment)
- To share research questions and insights with the community and discuss them openly.
- Test public beta versions of the app with a wide audience
