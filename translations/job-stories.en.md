# User Stories / Jobs to be Done

The GGD (Area Health Authority) have published the [Schedule of Requirements (PvE)](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/coronavirus-app/documenten/publicaties/2020/05/19/programma-van-eisen) to which the app must conform to. In addition we have created our own long list of requirements from the perspective of the people who will eventually use the application. In it we state what they would like and what the app should be able to do.
