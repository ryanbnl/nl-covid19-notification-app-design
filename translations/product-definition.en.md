## Product definition

The **notification app** is an **app** which helps **everyone in The Netherlands**, who wishes to protect **friends,
family and/or the economy from corona infections** to avoid unknowingly spreading the virus.

In support of the **analog contact tracing process**, we offer **the chance to more promptly warn people who you have
been in contact with, reaching even people who you do not know**.

### What does the app do?

The app makes use of the Google/Apple Exposure Notification API. This keeps a record, via Bluetooth Low Energy, of the mobile
telephones which have been in close contact with yours. This happens securely and anonymously.

The app warns the owner if they, in the previous 14 days, been in contact with another app-user who has tested
positive for COVID-19 and who was contagious at the time of contact.

De app waarschuwt de eigenaar als die in de afgelopen 14 dagen in de buurt is geweest van een app-gebruiker
die in de dagen na die ontmoeting positief getest is op COVID-19 en tijdens de ontmoeting mogelijk al besmettelijk was.

Upon testing positive for COVID-19 the user can report themselves as COVID-19 positive via the app. To avoid potential misuse
a one-time confirmation code issued by the GGD is required to make the report. Only after a positive report is made will users
who have been in contact with the infected user be warned.

### What does the app not do?

No personal data is saved in the app. The app knows nothing about the identity of the owner or of the phone.
In de app worden geen persoonsgegevens opgeslagen. De app weet niets over de identiteit van de eigenaar
van de telefoon.  

The app makes no use of location data and does not store this information. It make no use of GPS or any
other methods of determining the location.
De app maakt geen gebruik van locatiegegevens en slaat deze ook niet op. Niet met GPS, niet op een andere manier.

The app cannot determine if someone is infected with COVID-19. That is not technically possible. It is therefore
not a "COVID-radar" which protects you in your daily life. The app helps you - if you become infected - to avoid
passing the infection on to others.

The app does not remember if the owner of the telephone has tested positive or if they have received an exposure warning.
The app can therefore not be used as a "COVID-passport".

The app does not replace the work of the GGD (Area Health Authority). The manual contact tracing process will continue as normal. The main function of the app is to provide a faster - but less precise - addition to the existing process.

The app does not measure exact distances. It knows that you have been in close proximity to someone and
have been at risk of being infected. However it is not possible to determine exactly how close the distance actually was.

The encounters which are registered with Bluetooth Low Energy are only stored on and never leave the user's telephone. They are therefore not stored on any central server(s).
