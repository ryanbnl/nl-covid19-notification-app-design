### The app is designed for all audiences with a variety of demographic backgrounds and limitations (inclusivity).

In order to achieve a high adoption rate, we are designing an app that can be used by as large a proportion of the population as possible. Accessibility, understandability and ease of use take precedence over aesthetics. We take into account people with limited technical knowledge, low literacy level and various sensory and motor impairments. The design complies with WCAG2.1 AA.

### The app explains how digital contact tracing works, and reassures users about data privacy and security.

The app is clear about which techniques are used, which information is collected, how the information is used and with whom the information is shared. The app removes misunderstandings and ensures that users can make an informed decision about whether to install and use it or not. If someone chooses not to use the app then this will be their informed decision.

### The app is honest about the limitations of the technology and the perspectives for action are proportionate to that.

With Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) it is not possible to determine exactly how close users of the app may have been to each other. We only know a signal strength. In addition, much is still unknown about the spread of the virus. This means that we cannot make any statements about how great the risk has been that someone has transmitted the virus during an encounter. The *tone-of-voice* and the action perspectives offered are in proportion to this.

### The design works on a very wide range of mobile phones.

The application will be installed on a very wide range of mobile phones, including many older models. So there are limitations when it comes to screen size, capabilities of the mobile phones, etc. In addition, it is important that the app can be properly translated (localized) without making major changes to the design.

### The design is easy to implement.

Speed matters. In the design we use standard platform components for the user interface, so that it can be built quickly and efficiently. And developers can put their limited time and energy into the relatively complex underlying systems.
